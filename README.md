App Overview
MistyCast is a user-friendly weather application that gives a complete picture of the weather for any location. It's designed to be simple and intuitive, providing everything from real-time conditions to a long-range forecast. It can be easily switched between Celsius and Fahrenheit, save your favorite locations for quick access, and even get historical weather insights.

Key Features
This app provides a comprehensive set of features.

- Current Conditions: Displays real-time weather details, including the current temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and visibility.
- Forecasts: Offers both an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours and a daily forecast for up to 14 days.
- Location Search: Weather data can be fetched for any location by searching via an input field or by using the browser's geolocation feature.
- Interactive Map: A weather map, powered by OpenStreetMap and implemented with the Leaflet.js library, visualizes the location.
- Charts: Wind speed predictions for the coming days are displayed using a line chart created with the Chart.js library.
- Customization: Temperature units can be toggled between metric (째C, km/h) and imperial (째F, mph). Saved locations are stored in the browser's local storage for easy access.
- Additional Data: Displays sunrise and sunset times, the Air Quality Index (AQI), and a dedicated section for any active weather alerts.
- Historical Averages: The application can fetch historical weather data for the last five years and compute averages for the current date, which can then be compared to the present temperature.

Customizable Settings
The application features several user-configurable options. Locations can be searched, saved as "frequent spots," and re-selected with a single click. The temperature units can be toggled between metric (째C, km/h) and imperial (째F, mph).

Technical Implementation
The application is a single-page website that relies on a combination of web technologies.

- Structure with HTML: The layout, including the search bar, weather cards, and forecast sections, is defined using HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
- Design with CSS: A dark theme, fonts, and the responsive layout are all created with CSS. 
- Functionality with JavaScript: All interactive features, such as fetching weather data from a remote API, updating the content, and handling user input, are managed by JavaScript.
- Mapping and Charts: Leaflet.js, is used to display the interactive map, while the Chart.js library creates the visual wind chart.
- Data Source: Weather information is fetched from the WeatherAPI.com API.
